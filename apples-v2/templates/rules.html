            <li>One of the players will be randomly assigned to be the judge.</li>
            <li>All players will be dealt a private hand of seven red apple cards.</li>
            <li>A green apple card will be selected from the top of the stack and shown to all players.</li>
            <li>Players must then quickly choose the red apple card from their hand that they feel is best described by the green apple card.</li>
            <li>Once each player picks their red apple card, they must submit that card to the judge.</li>
            <li>The judge then views the chosen red apple cards but does not know who chose which cards.</li>
            <li>The chosen red apple cards are shown for all players to see with identities still hidden.</li>
            <li>Judge then selects the red apple card he or she thinks is best described by the green apple card.</li>
            <li>The player whose red apple card is selected by the judge is the winner of the round and is awarded the green apple card.</li>
            <li>To keep score, players count the green apple cards that they have won.</li>
            <li>After each round, the red apple cards are discarded and a new set of seven red apple cards are dealt to each player again.</li>
            <li>The role of judge is passed on to the next player and the next round begins</li>
            <li>The first player to reach a certain number of green cards wins the game!</li>
